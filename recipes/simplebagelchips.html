    <h1>Bagel Chips Recipe</h1>
    <img src="bagelchips.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Have you ever made homemade bagel chips? They are so easy!</p>
    <p>I used whole wheat bagels, but those are obviously boring.</p>
    <p>Cinnamon or asiago bagels would taste so much better.</p>
    <p>It is best to use bagels that are a bit stale. </p>    
    <p>Just slice them very thin, brush with olive oil and top with sea salt.</p> 
    <p>Or whatever else you may like.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 whole wheat bagels (mini)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425.</li>
        <li>Slice thin rounds from the bagel, using all pieces even if they break in half.
            Brush all pieces with olive oil and top with sea salt.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes but watch closely - oven times may differ.</li>
    </ol>
